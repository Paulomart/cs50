1.  A header files which provides more flexible and better performing int types.
2.  The int types provided by the stdint.h lib have fixed width in memory. The sizes of type does not change across different os's.
3.  BYTE = uint8_t = 8 Bits, DWORD = uint32_t = 32 Bits, LONG = int32_t = 32 Bits, WORD = uint16_t = 16 Bits
4.  0x42 0x4d or BM
5.  bfSize is the total size of the file. biSize is the amount of bits required by the header of the bmp file.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmaps content are top to bottom instead of bottom to top.
7.  biBitCount
8.  When the file is not found, the user does not have the right permissions to access it or there is not sufficient storage.
9.  The thrid argument is how many elements should be read/written, in our case this is always one element at the time.
10. (4 - (3 * 3 * 8) % 4) % 4 = 0
11. fseek skips n bytes.
12. SEEK_CUR is the mode how to seek forward, SEEK_CUR just jumps forward from the current position.
